## PUT ORGANISMS INTO SMALL AND LARGE CATEGORIES AND CALCULATE CR AND FR  ##
############################################################################

### 2/15/23
### Notes:
##  CR = V/T * (ln(mean control samples) - ln(experimental samples))/n
##  Clearance rate = (Volume of experimental container--595 ml)/ Time of experiment *
##  (ln of the mean of the control samples) - (ln of the experimental samples)/ the number
##  of copepods in the experimental bottle. Units of the result are mL per copepod per day

### Then calculate the initial samples cpm or biomass to be used to calculate ingestion (feeding)
##  rate, I = F x mean IC, Ingestion rate = Clearance rate  * 
##  the mean initial samples (counts or biomass)
##  Then calculate the Ingestion Rate
### Ingestion Rates units are in cells per copepod per day, or pgC  or Âµg C biomass per copepod per day,
##  I need to also calculate the median clearance rate for putting into the
##  feeding rate equation.

size_test <- volbio_all_cr

### _____NOTE!!! on 2/28/23, I removed the "type" from most of the Cpm code

sumBpmAll <- size_test %>%

### ______________________ OTHER CODE TRIALS____________________

### Note: use cumsum()? example:
##  df %>%  group_by(the columns that identify the organisms) %>% 
##  mutate (new column name = cumsum(cpm or bpm))

### Test below with just centric diatoms, since they are numerous enough that
##  I would have sufficient counts to make a comparison

size_test <- volbio_all_cr
size_test_tinLSZ2<- size_test %>% 
  filter(samp_ev == "LSZ2", Group == "tintinnid", size == "large") %>% 
  select(samp_ev, exp, rep, Group, type,  
         counts, cpm, size)# %>% 
#subset(cpm !=0)
### add the cpm of all pendia
size_test_pendia2 <- size_test_pendia %>% 
  #group_by(size) %>% 
  aggregate(cpm ~ samp_ev+exp+rep+size, FUN = sum)
#mutate(cpm_by_size = cumsum(cpm)) 

### Note about above: I learned that when using aggregate,
##  group_by is not needed

### Now use a base data frame with all the Groups and add Group
##  to the argument of what columns to match when adding
