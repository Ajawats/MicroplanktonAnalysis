### Not needed because clearance rate does not need to be calculated using
##  biomass, since it is a calcultion of the concentration of cells and
## the "volume swept clear"
##  But I wanted to save this just in case I need it later, because when
##  I compared this CR with the cells CR, it was slightly different, and
##  I thought it should have been the same, if it's a rate.

load("data/Clearance Rates/sumAll.Rdata") ### This df was made above and is the
##  base file for calculating the CR and FR for small and large groups

## Create the base data frame that has only the controls and experimentals,
##  using either counts per ml or biomass per ml
sumAllBpm_CE <- sumAll %>%
  filter( str_detect(exp, "C|E")) %>% 
  select(samp_ev, exp, rep,Group, size, bio_ugC_l)

### Create another df from the above, with only the control samples
sumAllBpm_C <- sumAllBpm_CE %>% 
  filter(exp == "C") 

### Create a df with only experimental samples
sumAllBpm_E <- sumAllBpm_CE %>% 
  filter(exp == "E") %>% 
  group_by(samp_ev, exp, rep, Group, bio_ugC_l, size) %>% 
  ungroup
names(sumAllBpm_E)[names(sumAllBpm_E) == 'bio_ugC_l'] <- 'bio_ugC_l_E'

### Apply the mean function to the controls df to get control mean counts or 
##  biomass per ml across  the three replicates. Leave out the rep column so 
##  that what remains in the df is one row for each individual organism/size 
##  and the mean of the control sample counts per ml or biomass per ml
sumAllBpm_Cmn <- sumAllBpm_C %>% 
  group_by(samp_ev, exp, Group, size) %>%
  summarize(Cmn_bio = mean(bio_ugC_l)) %>% 
  ungroup

### Since CR needs the mean control samples and the three replicates experimental
## samples, join the experimental sample df with the control means df. This will
##  necessarily include the rep column, since we need the experimental samples
## individual replicate counts or biomass for the calculation.
sumAllBpmE_Cmn <- 	left_join(sumAllBpm_E, sumAllBpm_Cmn, 
                             by = c("samp_ev", "Group", "size"))

### Remove unneeded columns, and rename and re-order remaining columns
names(sumAllBpmE_Cmn)
sumAllBpmE_Cmn <- select(sumAllBpmE_Cmn,

## since the CR was calculated for each replicate.

### Replace the NAs with 0 because if not, when R calculates the mean, if one of the reps has NA, but
##  the other one or two have a number, R will not calculate it and will return NA
